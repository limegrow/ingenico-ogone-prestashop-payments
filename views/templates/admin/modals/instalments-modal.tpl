                    <li>Using fixed rules, you would setup common parameters applicable for any customer who wants to pay for the order in
                        multiple instalments. Customers wouldn&apos;t be able to take any decision concerning the number of payments, the time
                        between them and the amount of the first payment.

                    <br>
                    <li>WIth the flexible rules, you give a possibility to choose those parameters between the specific values that you set up.
                        This option gives more freedom to your customers at the same time keeping them within the borders that you define.
